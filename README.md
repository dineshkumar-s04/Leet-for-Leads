It contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems, aimed at improving my problem-solving skills and preparing for coding interviews. 
I solve problems in languages like Java and Python, covering a wide range of topics such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, recursion, dynamic programming, graphs, and more. 
Each solution is organized by  using the format "ProblemNumber_ProblemName" for easy reference. 
My goal is to solve problems consistently, track progress, and revisit challenging problems to reinforce learning. 
This repo serves as both a study log and a resource for others who are also preparing for technical interviews.
